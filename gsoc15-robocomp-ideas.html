<p>RoboComp is a very complex open source robotics framework, documentation is a very important part of it. We just moved our repositories from sourceforge to github. But we are still in the need of porting some other social tools like the website, the wiki and some tutorials. Clarifiying the usage of RoboComp is an important asset towards achieven a full open source development model that could help us improve the framework and help the open source robotics community. Some work on documenting easing the installation process of the framework is also needed. Achieving an easy to understand documentation and set up would make easier to spread the knowledge about the framework and usage among the open source community.</p>

<p>Current instructions to download, install and start using the software are in <a href="http://www.github.com/robocomp/robocomp">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Among the main stacks of robocomp is the computer vision stack. There are currently plenty of components performing computer vision algorithms.  Comming up with a well documented and structured stack and libraries that can perform the main state of the art vision algotihms will help any new developer to easily perform vision task without much effort. Among the key tasks on this idea would be to create and select the componentsa and libraries performing vision tasks and group them together and document them. Some algorithms could also be added to complete the tools. </p>
