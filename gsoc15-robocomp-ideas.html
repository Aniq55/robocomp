<a id="robocomp-social-management" class="anchor" href="#robocomp-social-management" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1.- RoboComp tutorial, social management and documentation</h3>

<p>Website needs to be ported to github pages, along with the old wiki and all its tutorials. A markdown language will be used to write new posts and website updates. Old tutorials need to be ported and polished to make it understandable by final users. Also, new tutorials have to be developed using RoboComp’s robotics simulator, that guide the new users through the subtleties of distributed programming in robotic architectures. This package also includes work on automated installation scripts using CMake in order to ease the usage of the framework and reduce the learning curve. Generic knowledge of website and wiki administration is needed.  
This is a key task for our project as it would bring more attention to it as it will open the development to new people interested in the field. This will “open” the project to new users and developers on the open source community. </p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate programming and systems administration.</p>

<a id="computer-vision-stack" class="anchor" href="#computer-vision-stack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2.- Computer vision components and libraries management</h3>

<p>Among the main stacks of robocomp is the computer vision stack. There are currently plenty of components performing computer vision algorithms.  Coming up with a well documented and structured stack and libraries that can perform the main state of the art vision algorithms will help any new developer to easily perform vision task without much effort. Among the key tasks on this idea would be to create and select the components and libraries performing vision tasks and group them together and document them. Some algorithms could also be added to complete the tools. </p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate computer vision knowledge, C++ programming, basic CMake knowledge </p>

<a id="cmake-buidling-system-desing" class="anchor" href="#cmake-buidling-system-desing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.- RoboComp Building and deployment system design</h3>


<p>Current CMake building system when run from the root of the project is only able to build libraries and some tools. It would be nice to come up with a CMake structure that can build the entire system, including all components, without breaking current dependencies and leaving the option to compile per component. Components and libraries dependencies should be taken into account. This works needs also to take into account the dependencies between components that can be stored in an xml like files within the component itself.   </p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate CMake knowledge, programming in C++, basic knowledge of shell scripting </p>

<a id="cmake-buidling-system-desing" class="anchor" href="#cmake-buidling-system-desing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4.- Deployment generator </h3>

<p>When creating a specific robot architecture, many components have to be brought into a common deployment environment. Each component has its runtime configuration and network parameters that have to be declared in a common deployment file, from where the complete system can be brought to life. This task proposes the design of domain specific language to facilitate the creation of deployment files that are syntactically and semantically correct. We will be using Python as the development language with pyparsing and cog as DSL generation tools.</p>

<p>Required student level: intermediate programming with Python and introductory knowledge of formal languages</p>
